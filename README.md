### Prepare for the Workshop

R is a statistical software that is <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">free, open-source, and can run on most operating systems</a>. This means that anyone in the world with access to a computer and the internet can use it and anyone in the world can contribute to the development of new tools in R. 

R can do everything that paid statistical software like SPSS and SAS can do, and often more! <a href = "http://r4stats.com/2019/05/28/data-science-jobs-report-2019-python-way-up-tensorflow-growing-rapidly-r-use-double-sas/">Analysis of data on job openings and other metrics</a> shows that R is increasingly included as a desired or required skill, often surpassing traditional closed source software like SPSS and SAS. R is particularly great for **data management** and developing amazing **data visualizations**. 

To follow along during the workshop, you will need to do two things ahead of time: 

<ol>
<li> Install R and R Studio 
<li> Download and save course materials
</ol>
  
Follow the instructions below to install and download everything you will need.

### Install R and R Studio

R is the software and R Studio is the IDE (Interactive Development Environment) that makes R easier to use. Install R **before** you install R Studio because R Studio will look for R during installation.

First, download and install R:

<ul>
  <li> Click the <b>download R</b> link on the <a href = "https://www.r-project.org">R Project for Statistical Computing</a> website
  <li> Choose one of the options from the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> list (it doesn't matter which one!)
  <li> Click on the download that is appopropriate for your operating system, Linux, Mac, or Windows; if you are not given this option, go back to the <a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN Mirrors</a> and try a different one
  <li> For Windows machines, find the link for <b>install R for the first time</b> and click on it and then the <b>Download R</b> link on the page that opens, for MacOS, click on the <b>.pkg</b> file that fits your operating system and it will download the installer
  <li> Use the installer that downloads to install R 
</ul>

Second, download and install R Studio:

<ul>
  <li> Go to the R Studio <a href = "https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/"> downloads page</a> 
  <li> Click on the DOWNLOAD button under the RStudio Desktop column on the downloads page
  <li> Choose the Download for the operating system you have and click on it  
  <li> Use the installer that downloads to install R Studio 
</ul>

### Download and Save Workshop Materials

Download the participant files and save them together in the same folder on your computer:

<ul>
<li> Click on the green Code button toward the top of this GitHub page
<li> Choose Download ZIP
<li> Unzip the downloaded zip file and save all the files in a single folder on your computer somewhere you can find it 
</ul>
